  <p>You've probably heard the news. OpenAI, the company that brought us ChatGPT, has started running adverts. Yes, the AI everyone uses to avoid doing things has itself become a thing you have to navigate around. Welcome to 2026.</p>

  <p>But before you roll your eyes and click away, hear this out. The launch of the ChatGPT advertising platform in February 2026 is genuinely significant, and not just because it's another place to spend your marketing budget. It signals a proper shift in how people search for information, make buying decisions, and interact with brands online. The "type something into Google and click the third result" era is quietly packing its bags.</p>

  <p>This blog breaks down what ChatGPT ads actually are, why measuring them is a bit of a headache, what "agentic commerce" means for e-commerce brands, and why you now need to think about something called GEO alongside your SEO.</p>

  <p>Grab a brew. Let's get into it.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>How ChatGPT Ads Actually Work</h2>

  <h3>Who Sees Them (and Who Doesn't)</h3>

  <p>OpenAI began rolling out adverts in the US on 9th February 2026, initially for logged-in adult users on the Free and Go tiers (Go costs $8/month). If you're on the Plus, Pro, or Enterprise plans, you won't see ads. So essentially, the people paying more get the ad-free experience, which is roughly how every streaming platform works now too.</p>

  <p>Ads appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses, clearly labelled as "Sponsored." They come in the form of text blocks, visual ad cards, and links, so nothing too alarming visually.</p>

  <h3>No Cookies. No Tracking. Just Context.</h3>

  <p>Here's where it gets interesting. ChatGPT advertising doesn't use cookies, behavioural tracking, or demographic data. There's no "we know you were looking at trainers last Tuesday" targeting going on here.</p>

  <p>Instead, it uses <strong>contextual targeting</strong>, which means the ad you see is based entirely on what you're talking about <em>right now</em> in that conversation. If someone asks ChatGPT for advice on planning a kitchen renovation, they might see an ad from a kitchen retailer. It's intent-based advertising in the most literal sense possible.</p>

  <p>This is actually quite a big deal. You're not targeting a vague audience segment. You're reaching someone who is, at that exact moment, demonstrating genuine interest in your topic.</p>

  <h3>The Price Tag</h3>

  <p>This premium targeting comes with a premium price. Early CPMs (the cost per 1,000 impressions) are sitting around $60. For context, that's roughly three times the rate on Meta and about twenty times what you'd pay on the Google Display Network. Early enterprise testers like Target and Williams-Sonoma had minimum spends of $200,000.</p>

  <p>So no, this isn't a platform for a small local business with a £500/month ad budget. Not yet, anyway. But understanding how it works now means you're prepared when it becomes more accessible.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>The Measurement Problem (Or: How to Track ROI Without a Pixel)</h2>

  <p>If you've run digital ads before, you're probably used to having a pixel sitting on your website, quietly noting who visited, what they did, and whether they bought anything. ChatGPT ads don't offer that. OpenAI prioritises user privacy, which means there's no conversion pixel, no identity resolution, and no view-through attribution.</p>

  <p>What you <em>do</em> get is aggregate impression and click data. Which is better than nothing, but it's not exactly the granular reporting most marketers are used to.</p>

  <h3>What You Can Do Instead</h3>

  <p>This doesn't mean measurement is impossible. It just means you need to adapt your approach:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>UTM parameters:</strong> Tag every link meticulously so you can track traffic in Google Analytics or whatever you're using.</li>
    <li><strong>Brand lift studies:</strong> Run surveys before and after campaigns to measure shifts in brand awareness and perception.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct traffic and branded search monitoring:</strong> Watch for spikes in people typing your brand name directly into Google. A rise here often signals that awareness activity is working.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-reported attribution:</strong> The humble "How did you hear about us?" field in your checkout or enquiry form is suddenly more valuable than ever. Don't underestimate it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It's a bit more old-school in some ways, but these methods have always been solid. We just got lazy when pixels did all the work for us.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Agentic Commerce: Buying Without Leaving the Chat</h2>

  <p>This is the part that should really get the attention of anyone running an e-commerce business.</p>

  <p>Thanks to something called the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), developed in collaboration with Shopify, Stripe, and Google, users can now <strong>complete purchases directly inside ChatGPT</strong> without ever opening a new tab or visiting your website.</p>

  <p>Here's how it works in practice: a user asks ChatGPT to recommend a birthday gift for someone who likes gardening. ChatGPT suggests a few products. The user taps one, and with a single tap, they've bought it. Done. No redirect, no loading screens, no basket abandonment.</p>

  <p>For Shopify merchants especially, enabling "Instant Checkout" through this system means your product could be discovered and purchased entirely within the ChatGPT interface. That's a genuinely new kind of customer journey, and it removes several of the friction points that cause people to abandon purchases halfway through.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p>If you sell products online and you haven't looked into how your store integrates with this yet, it's worth putting on your to-do list now rather than when everyone else is scrambling to catch up.</p>
  </div>

  <hr />

  <h2>GEO: The Organic Side of the AI Conversation</h2>

  <p>Paid ads aside, there's something just as important happening on the organic side: your business needs to be visible to AI models, not just search engines.</p>

  <p>Traditional SEO gets you ranked on Google. <strong>Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO)</strong> gets you cited when someone asks an AI a question relevant to your business. These are increasingly different things.</p>

  <p>When someone searches Google, they see a list of links and choose one. When someone asks ChatGPT, they get a synthesised answer, often with no links at all. If your business isn't being cited in those answers, you're invisible to a growing number of people who never get as far as a search results page.</p>

  <h3>How to Build AI Visibility</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear headings and structure:</strong> AI models retrieve information more easily from content that's well-organised and unambiguous.</li>
    <li><strong>Entity density:</strong> Make sure your content clearly and repeatedly references the key topics, products, services, and concepts relevant to your business. Don't assume the AI will infer things.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured schema markup:</strong> This is technical, but your web developer can help. Schema markup helps AI systems (and search engines) understand what your content is about.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party validation:</strong> Being mentioned and cited on reputable external sites, in press coverage, and in industry publications builds what's called "citation authority." The more trustworthy sources reference you, the more likely AI models are to include you in responses.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>GEO isn't a replacement for SEO. It's an additional layer that's becoming increasingly important as more people use AI as their first port of call for information.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Three Things to Do Right Now</h2>

  <p>You don't need to overhaul everything overnight. But here are three sensible starting points:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Audit your content for AI readability.</strong> Go through your key website pages and blog posts. Are they clearly structured? Do they explain what you do in plain, direct language? Are there headings that an AI model could easily extract answers from? If not, that's your first job.</li>
    <li><strong>Set up self-reported attribution if you haven't already.</strong> Add "How did you hear about us?" to your checkout or contact forms. Start collecting that data now so you have a baseline before AI-driven traffic increases.</li>
    <li><strong>If you're a Shopify merchant, look into ChatGPT's commerce integrations.</strong> The ability to sell directly through AI conversations is here, and getting set up early means you're not scrambling later.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  <p>The way people find businesses, research purchases, and ultimately spend their money is changing. ChatGPT ads are one visible sign of that shift, but the deeper change is in how AI is becoming part of the buying journey altogether.</p>

  <p>The good news is that none of this requires you to understand machine learning or start speaking in acronyms. It just requires staying curious, adapting your approach, and not waiting until everyone else has already figured it out.</p>

  <p>You're already ahead just by reading this far. That's a decent start.</p>
